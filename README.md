**BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION USING CNN**
Brain tumor categorization is a key issue in medical imaging analysis because it plays an important role in patient diagnosis and therapy planning. The accurate and efficient classification of brain tumors can assist healthcare practitioners in making informed decisions and providing appropriate care. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a formidable tool for automated image processing, with significant potential in the field of medical picture classification.

The goal of this project is to develop a brain tumor classification system using CNNs. By leveraging the capabilities of CNNs, we aim to create a model that can learn complex patterns and features from brain tumor images, enabling accurate classification and identification of different tumor types.
CNNs have gained appeal in medical image analysis due to their capacity to automatically train hierarchical representations directly from raw picture data. CNNs are made up of layers, such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for spatial downsampling. This architecture enables the network to capture both local and global information in the input images, making it ideal for applications like tumor classification.

To develop a brain tumor classification system, a diverse set of brain MRI datasets, encompassing various tumor types such as gliomas, meningiomas, and metastatic tumors, will be collected. Images with no tumor will also be included in the dataset as a baseline for comparison. To ensure uniformity and normalization of the images, preprocessing techniques will be used.
Using a custom 2D CNN lets us tweak the architecture specifically for brain tumor classification, optimizing its performance for this purpose. By constructing our own network, we have the freedom to experiment with various architectural choices and hyperparameters to attain the best possible outcomes.

To build the brain tumor classification system, the first step would be to collect a large collection of brain tumor photos. This collection will include photos of gliomas, meningiomas, metastatic tumors, and non-tumor images for comparison. Careful consideration will be paid to ensuring the dataset's diversity and balance, portraying the differences and complexities prevalent in real-world circumstances.
